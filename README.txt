This is a small python app to delay all the cards in a specific anki deck by 1 day. 
You have to find the location of your library and use open the SQL database to 
find the specific decks that you want to alter. I used SQLite.
A lot of info about anki databases can be found: https://www.juliensobczak.com/tell/2016/12/26/anki-scripting.html

This is extremely specific to the location of my anki database and decks.
You will have to change them if you want to use this on your own.

This is rough, but it's holding me over until I can find the time to turn this into
an actual anki plugin.
